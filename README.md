The Complete iOS 13 Developer Course - and Swift UI! - Course on Udemy - personal repo

## Course Goals:

To work at least 15-20 mins a day to learn something new about Swift or work on an ongoing project using existing Swift knowledge. This goal will continue until I have completed the iPhone app that I would like to have built and connected with watchOS.

## Course Used:

This repo is full of the work I have done while working towards completing [the course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ios-developer-course-with-swift/). It was made by Rob Percival and Atil Samancioglu and has been fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone looking to learn iOS 13.
